    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",

    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",

    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "Sql has a rigid table format whereas nosql does not have that requirement\n",

    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "When making a row for each instance of data would require too much redundant data or would have unnecesary runtime. For ex Facebook friend network would need the ability to look at your friends profiles. You can either have a row for each link, Which you would then need to find each link or have it represented as a graph and have all the links stored with the profile\n",

    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "Distributed Databases may fail, and as such need the ability to account for such a failure\n",
